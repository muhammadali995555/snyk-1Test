# API Middleware

Instead of each component handling API calls in the same way we have the API Middleware that will handle it.

`APIActions` can be imported from 'webpack/assets/javascripts/react_app/redux/API/index.js'
or 'foremanReact/redux/API/index.js' for plugins

`APIActions` contains the following methods: `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `patch` which can be also imported independently, e.g:

```js
import { get, post, put, patch } from '../../redux/API';
// can't import 'delete' as it's a reserved word in JS.
```

## How to use it in your action

```js
import { get } from '../../redux/API';

const someAction = url =>
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY, // this will be used later to identify your API call, so keep it unique.
    url,
    params: {}, // some params you will want to pass to the API request.
    headers: {}, // some headers you will want to pass to the API request.
  });
```

or

```js
dispatch(
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY, // this will be used later to identify your API call, so keep it unique.
    url,
    params: {}, // some params you will want to pass to the API request.
    headers: {}, // some headers you will want to pass to the API request.
  })
);
```

Then there will be called 2 actions: **MY_SPECIAL_KEY_REQUEST** and **MY_SPECIAL_KEY_SUCCESS/ MY_SPECIAL_KEY_FAILURE**:
**MY_SPECIAL_KEY_REQUEST** will have the payload only
**MY_SPECIAL_KEY_SUCCESS** will have the payload and the return data from the API call.
**MY_SPECIAL_KEY_FAILURE** will have the payload and the return error from the API call.

In the **payload** field you should send any headers and params for the GET request, and any other data you want for the action.

The actions types can be changed with the optional **actionTypes** parameter:

```js
dispatch(
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY, // this will be used later to identify your API call, so keep it unique.
    url,
    params: {} // some params you will want to pass to the API request.
    headers: {}, // some headers you will want to pass to the API request.
    actionTypes: {
      REQUEST: 'CUSTOM_REQUEST',
      SUCCESS: 'CUSTOM_SUCCESS',
      FAILURE: 'CUSTOM_FAILURE',
    },
  })
);
```

## Main API Reducer

The API will manage the request lifecycle in the redux store > API > the provided key, e.g:

```js
{
  API: {
    MY_COMPONENT_KEY: { // this is the key you provided in the API action.
      status: 'RESOLVED',
      payload, // the payload you passed to the API action
      response, // the API response. it will store data on success or error on failure.
    }
  }
}
```

it will manage the request statuses, errors and responses.

### Access the API store

We provided you the `selectAPIByKey` in '/APISelectors.js' which will return the key substate,
there are also `selectAPIStatus`, `selectAPIPayload`, `selectAPIResponse`, `selectAPIError` and `selectAPIErrorMessage`.

## Error handling

In case you want to invoke some method or action immediately when an error occurs,
we support the `handleError` param where you could pass an error handling function, e.g:

```js
dispatch(
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY,
    url,
    handleError: error => error.response.status === 401 ? logoutUser() : null
    ...
  })
);
```

The error handling function will receive the error object from the API request.

## Success handling

In case you want to invoke some method or action immediately after the request succeed,
we support the `handleSuccess` param where you could pass a success handling function, e.g:

```js
dispatch(
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY,
    url,
    handleSuccess: response => { dispatch(addToast({ type: 'success' })) },
    ...
  })
);
```

The success handling function will receive the response object from the API request.

In case you are also using the interval middleware with the same `KEY`,
the `stopInterval` for your key will be passed as the second param in your `handleSuccess`/ `handleError` callbacks.

## Toast handling

Instead of managing and dispatching the toast action by yourself, you can use the API middleware shortcuts,
by passing `toastSuccess` or `toastError` as keys in the API action, e.g:

```js
dispatch(
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY,
    url,
    toastError: error => `Oh no! Something went wrong while submitting the form, the server returned the following error: ${error}`
    toastSuccess: response => `Yay! task: ${response.taskID} was successfully created.`
  })
);
```

## Update resources object

After an API request SUCCESS action, it is often reconfirmed with a second GET request to view the updated data, and keep the Redux store up to date.
However, if we receive a SUCCESS it is acceptable to assume that the data was actually updated as requested, and not completely necessary to make the additional request.
To facilitate this, the API middleware can accept an `updateData` callback which returns the updated resource object corresponding to its key.
Thus, Redux's copy of the backend data is changed based on this trust, and an additional API request to show the updated data is avoided.

`updateData` callback accepts two arguments, prevState and currentResponse:

#### prevState
The previous response data which stored on redux store and corresponding with the given key.

#### currentResponse
The current API call response.


Examples:

```js
// This action creates a post API call and only if it ends succesfully,
// the response object will update with the returned data from 'updateData' callback 
dispatch(
  post({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY,
    url,
    updateData: (prevResponseState, currentResponse) => ({
      results: prevStateData.filter(
        item => item.id !== currentResponse.id
      ),
    }),
  })
);
```

```js
post({
  key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY,
  url,
  params: { id: selectedID }
  updateData: prevResponseState => ({
    results: prevResponseState.filter(
      item => item.id !== selectedID
    ),
  }),
})
```
